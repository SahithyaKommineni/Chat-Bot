# Chat-Bot
Created a chat model using the model which can answers you questions of any domain as per it's knowledge base.
Used the Mistral api key in order to generate the model interactive.
Mistral api is hidden in the code.
If you wnat to create the api key visit "https://console.mistral.ai/"

Steps to run:
  (If pip installed perform these steps.If pip not installed first install pip and then perform.)
  1. pip install -r requirements.txt
  2. pip install streamlit requests
  3. python -m streamlit run app.py
  (after running the 3rd step it generates a local host which when visited show the the chatbot.)
  
The code in chatbot.py is the code that I used for deploying the app using streamlit share.
You can deploy it here "https://share.streamlit.io/".
